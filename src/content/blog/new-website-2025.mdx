This website is built on [Astro](http://astro.build), using the [Astro Nano](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano) template, and it's inspired by a few blogs I follow around the web ([Steph Hango’s](https://stephango.com) one in primis).

I still love playing around with code and, while my career path has brought far away from the action, working on this small corner of the web is my way of keeping my skills somewhat in shape.

I've had my eyes set on Astro and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for a while…

The site is hosted using [Netfify](https://netlify.com), which has an incredibly generous free tier, updates the website shortly after I submit a change in [GitHub](https://github.com), and has a nice AI tool to inspect deployment issues. [^netlify]

[^netlify]: This is AI integration done right: it helps you understand what went wrong and suggested you how to fix it, providing context and explanation.
