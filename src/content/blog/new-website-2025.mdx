This website is built on [Astro](http://astro.build), using the [Astro Nano](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano) template, and it's inspired by a few blogs I follow around the web ([Steph Hango’s](https://stephango.com) one in primis).

I still love playing around with code and, while my career path has brought far away from the action, working on this small corner of the web is my way of keeping my skills somewhat in shape.

I've had my eyes set on Astro and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for a while…

The site is hosted using [Netfify](https://netlify.com), which has an incredibly generous free tier, updates the website shortly after I submit a change in [GitHub](https://github.com), and has a nice AI tool to inspect deployment issues. [^netlify]

[^netlify]: This is AI integration done right: it helps you understand what went wrong and suggested you how to fix it, providing context and explanation.

I have to admit that, until now, it's been more a matter of trial and error instead of a learning process. But they often go hand in hand anyway.

Even if I kept most of the Astro Nano template as I found it, I anyway applied some changes here and there:

### External links open in a new tab

This was achieved using this plugin

### Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs appear next to the site title

### Reply button

Every post has a "Reply via email" button at the bottom of the page.

### Work page

I combined the projects and work page into one
