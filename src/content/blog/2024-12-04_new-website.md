I know it sounds absurd but yes, I migrated this site again. It’s the third time in less than a year, I think. So, why did I do that?

Honestly, I really like [Blot](https://blot.im) [^blot] as a concept:

[^blot]: Where I was hosting the previous iteration of this website.

> Blot turns a folder into a website. Files become posts on your site. Drag-and-drop to publish.
>
> There’s no interface, just files. So you can use your favorite tools to work on your site. Focus on creating.
>
> Write your blog with your favorite text editor. Vim or Microsoft Word, both work with Blot. Publish your photos from Lightroom. Work on your site with others using Google Docs or git.

The only problems I had with it where my fault:

- I set Blot up using git, therefore losing the benefit of just drag and dropping a file to a folder to automatically publish it
- I don’t publish enough to justify the (really small fee) of 5€ / month

So I went with [Astro](https://astro.build)
