As tradition, I redesigned my website for the new year. After moving to Webflow in 2021 and hosting a simple HTML site in Github in 2022, this year I decided to go back to **Hugo** for a few reasons.

As much as I love Webflow, I can't justify its price for what is, in the end, a passion project that I don't update nearly as much as I should.

On the other hand, a static HTML site is ok for a such a small site but it's not sustainable when you want to have a blog as well.

I wanted something cheap, easy to manage and with good customisation options. Hugo checks all these three boxes.

- Hugo is **open source** and the site is hosted on Github, all for free.
- Posts are written using **Markdown** and you can use your preferred app to manage them.
- There are themes available which can easily be customised using **CSS**.

For more information on how to set up your site with Hugo have a look at their [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/). If you want to have a look at how I set up this website, here's the [Github repository](https://github.com/francesco-puppo/website).
